# Solve Puzzles

If you don't know what this is about, you probably won't care.
This was for a P&T project where we'd ask people to come here from Mechanical
Turk, then choose whether to be anonymous or not. Never saw the light of day
because you can't ask people for identifiable info on Mechanical Turk.

Currently at http://solve-puzzles.appspot.com

app.yaml configures which URLs go where
main.py is the server-side code
index.html is the main page you hit when you go to the site (there's a lot of, well, boilerplate there, but it's hopefully not too difficult to find what you're looking for)
page2.html is the next page you hit
css and javascript are in their respective folders

Built with App Engine, python and HTML5 Boilerplate
