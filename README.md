# Solve Puzzles

If you don't know what this is about, you probably won't care.

Currently at http://solve-puzzles.appspot.com

app.yaml configures which URLs go where
main.py is the server-side code
index.html is the main page you hit when you go to the site (there's a lot of, well, boilerplate there, but it's hopefully not too difficult to find what you're looking for)
page2.html is the next page you hit
css and javascript are in their respective folders

Built with App Engine, python and HTML5 Boilerplate
